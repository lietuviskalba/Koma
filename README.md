# Final idea (for now)

A board shaped like the brain of a mouse in a soviet research laboratory. You can see the brain of the mouse. As the player, you start at the spine of the brain. On the brain you can move by nodes, one per turn. These nodes are scattered through the brain. You move through them to get to one of the 3 bigger nodes marked with an “S” on them. You do that to bring salt cards to them. Each player starts off with a random dice roll of salt (1 pip = 1 ml g of salt). Each node requires a specific amount of salt. You figure that out for each node, by rolling the dice 3 times for each “S” node. As you draw cards moving each node, there is a chance to draw a bacteria card, which you will have to face in battle. You battle bacteria through a six sided dice and follow the fighting guide for that bacteria, by reading what's written on the card. You beat the game once you deliver the salt to the node.

# Play testing
It's finally here folks! Here, we will finally have some people (other than ourselves) to play our game. As a result of this endeavour. We, the Woke Cheese, will get to see, early on, any bugs in OUR game that might occur (even though statistically that's impossible). Also, test and see, our current game balance and parameters, hold up with two players playing. In the video below (click the tool image) we list a detailed view of our playtest.

But if your more of reader then this is how it all went down:
We first set up our equipment (laptops, notes, etc.) and invite the testers.
Then we introduce to the testers, what's going on. Allow them to read the rules and once they are ready, begin the test.
During the test we stay quiet and observe our subjects.
After the session we ask for feedback, fill out a form and record the metadata.
Finally our dev team reflects on the feedback and comes up with improvements.

And that is OUR playtest session.

# Agile development with SCRUM

## Sprint agreed rules
The print is conducted by team woke cheese for a board game Кома. The development team has decided that a single sprint will take no longer than 3 weeks. The roles are agreed by each team member by a democratic vote. The end product is a board game.

## Roles
Product owner: Mantas
SCRUM master: Reinhold
Development team: Reinhold, Adrian, Mantas

## Scrum board
A board. Nodes to walk through. Player pieces. Lines connecting nodes. Rough sketch of the art of the board. Salt card increase and decrease. Bacteria card. Bacterial combat. Produce a dozen of each card. Play test session with the team. Block of node cards. Add enemy variety. Add possibility for a second player to join. Balance the game up. Conduct a play test session. Define the artwork for the board, player piece, card (salt, bacteria, other…). Set a space for card deck to be stored on the board. Section for the discard pile. 

### Sprint #1
We would begin by developing the core of our game. Features that would enable us to produce MVP. This would include making the board. Then proceed to adding to the board things like: nodes(10), the lines between the nodes, start position, salt delivery node (one). Then a player character what would be a simple cube (as a placeholder), 10 cards (2 that have bacteria, 4 more salt, 4 less salt). All the cards would be in word form (no sprites just yet). Get a dice. Beginner rules: roll dice 3 times to see the amount of salt needed for a salt node. Explain the simple combat mechanic. Overall timer for the game (30 moves). Win condition to bring thee right amount of salt. Finally end up with a prototype.

### Sprint #2
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). We will continue to play test the game. Add more features such as expend the number of Salt nodes, nodes in general and add a second player. Add more special cards (such as time increase, disconnect node and etc.). Play tune and design the overall level. Finally end up with an Updated prototype.

### Sprint #3
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). We will continue to play test the game. Add more card features. Introduce some rudimentary art work (board, cards, player figure). Preparation for a controlled playtest with a small group of people (Preparing the script, play test environment, questionnaire card for the participants). Evaluate the feedback. Play test ourselves. Update the prototype.

### Sprint #4
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). Play test ourselves. Update new visuals. Rework problems based on feedback. Prepare a new playtest. Do the play test. Review feedback. Write a story. Update prototype.

### Sprint #5
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). Play test ourselves. Refine the visuals. Rework problems based on feedback. Polish game. Polish story. Finish with a product.

## Final product
A board game theme in soviet cold war laboratory. Where a mouse is on the operating table (the board) is dying and it’s blood cells (you, the player) try to save the comunist mouse brain. As the blood cell you jump from node to node on the board until you reach one of the salt nodes. Depending if you have the right amount of salt (based on the dice roll in the beginning of the amount of salt required per  salt node). Each node you move you draw a card and there is a chance to enter combat with a bacteria (role dice 1 by 1, depending if you kill it or lose an amount of salt). You win by delivering the right amount of salt to each node before the timer runs out.

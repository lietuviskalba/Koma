# Final idea (for now)

A board shaped like the brain of a mouse in a soviet research laboratory. You can see the brain of the mouse. As the player, you start at the spine of the brain. On the brain you can move by nodes, one per turn. These nodes are scattered through the brain. You move through them to get to one of the 3 bigger nodes marked with an “S” on them. You do that to bring salt cards to them. Each player starts off with a random dice roll of salt (1 pip = 1 ml g of salt). Each node requires a specific amount of salt. You figure that out for each node, by rolling the dice 3 times for each “S” node. As you draw cards moving each node, there is a chance to draw a bacteria card, which you will have to face in battle. You battle bacteria through a six sided dice and follow the fighting guide for that bacteria, by reading what's written on the card. You beat the game once you deliver the salt to the node.

# Play testing
It's finally here folks! Here, we will finally have some people (other than ourselves) to play our game. As a result of this endeavour. We, the Woke Cheese, will get to see, early on, any bugs in OUR game that might occur (even though statistically that's impossible). Also, test and see, our current game balance and parameters, hold up with two players playing. In the video below (click the tool image) we list a detailed view of our playtest.

But if your more of reader then this is how it all went down:
We first set up our equipment (laptops, notes, etc.) and invite the testers.
Then we introduce to the testers, what's going on. Allow them to read the rules and once they are ready, begin the test.
During the test we stay quiet and observe our subjects.
After the session we ask for feedback, fill out a form and record the metadata.
Finally our dev team reflects on the feedback and comes up with improvements.

And that is OUR playtest session.

# Agile development with SCRUM

## Sprint agreed rules
The print is conducted by team woke cheese for a board game Кома. The development team has decided that a single sprint will take no longer than 3 weeks. The roles are agreed by each team member by a democratic vote. The end product is a board game.

## Roles
Product owner: Mantas
SCRUM master: Reinhold
Development team: Reinhold, Adrian, Mantas

## Scrum board
A board. Nodes to walk through. Player pieces. Lines connecting nodes. Rough sketch of the art of the board. Salt card increase and decrease. Bacteria card. Bacterial combat. Produce a dozen of each card. Play test session with the team. Block of node cards. Add enemy variety. Add possibility for a second player to join. Balance the game up. Conduct a play test session. Define the artwork for the board, player piece, card (salt, bacteria, other…). Set a space for card deck to be stored on the board. Section for the discard pile. 

### Sprint #1
We would begin by developing the core of our game. Features that would enable us to produce MVP. This would include making the board. Then proceed to adding to the board things like: nodes(10), the lines between the nodes, start position, salt delivery node (one). Then a player character what would be a simple cube (as a placeholder), 10 cards (2 that have bacteria, 4 more salt, 4 less salt). All the cards would be in word form (no sprites just yet). Get a dice. Beginner rules: roll dice 3 times to see the amount of salt needed for a salt node. Explain the simple combat mechanic. Overall timer for the game (30 moves). Win condition to bring thee right amount of salt. Finally end up with a prototype.

### Sprint #2
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). We will continue to play test the game. Add more features such as expend the number of Salt nodes, nodes in general and add a second player. Add more special cards (such as time increase, disconnect node and etc.). Play tune and design the overall level. Finally end up with an Updated prototype.

### Sprint #3
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). We will continue to play test the game. Add more card features. Introduce some rudimentary art work (board, cards, player figure). Preparation for a controlled playtest with a small group of people (Preparing the script, play test environment, questionnaire card for the participants). Evaluate the feedback. Play test ourselves. Update the prototype.

### Sprint #4
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). Play test ourselves. Update new visuals. Rework problems based on feedback. Prepare a new playtest. Do the play test. Review feedback. Write a story. Update prototype.

### Sprint #5
Have a sprint meeting (what we did, what we will do, what are the problems). Play test ourselves. Refine the visuals. Rework problems based on feedback. Polish game. Polish story. Finish with a product.

## Final product
A board game theme in soviet cold war laboratory. Where a mouse is on the operating table (the board) is dying and it’s blood cells (you, the player) try to save the comunist mouse brain. As the blood cell you jump from node to node on the board until you reach one of the salt nodes. Depending if you have the right amount of salt (based on the dice roll in the beginning of the amount of salt required per  salt node). Each node you move you draw a card and there is a chance to enter combat with a bacteria (role dice 1 by 1, depending if you kill it or lose an amount of salt). You win by delivering the right amount of salt to each node before the timer runs out.

### Koma story
The story takes place in fantasy Earth of 1966 during the cold war, where various creatures are anthropomorphic (such as blood cells, bacteria, tapeworms). The action and sequences take place in a communist mouse named Артур (Arthur) body.

The story begins of  Артур (Arthur the comunist mouse), all bloody and dirty, crawling, in the snowy night, to a secret soviet laboratory in the Oregon state of America. Upon arrival of the front gate the mouses collapses and is picked up by one of the scientists. During the medical procedure we learn that Артур was sent off by the KGB to steal the schematics for a water dam, from the USA state of California. During the mission he was spotted by the CIA and was badly wounded. Nonetheless he managed to retrieve the information and store it in his head. However the experience left the mouse in a Кома (coma).
In the next act time will shift back a few hours back. During this time we will see the lives of three blood cells Вадим (Vadim the oldest brother, devout soviet patriot), Иван (Ivan grandfather of the two other blood cells, reminiscent of the old days and a massive alcoholic) and Smith (youngest brother, indoctrinated by the western culture and values). They are going to be our protagonist. Each short introduction will reveal an indepth look of their character and how they interact with each other. After the mouse gets hurt by the CIA the blood cells are instructed to do repairs, by the body. During the repairs they will have their first encounter with the bacteria and the tapeworm Lucifer, the main antagonist. The antagonist tries to pursue convince Иван (Ivan the grandfather) to join his cause of overtaking the mouse's body and controlling themselves. The grandfather sell refuses.  In the aftermath, Lucifer escapes towards the brain. The trio have an argument of badly fighting the tapeworm and whether or not they should wait for the white cell backup or pursue the tapework themselves.
A blood clot in the vain disconnects them from the rest of the body. As such the trio is now the only one that can stop Lucifer. During the journey to the brain they learn that Lucifer is not their only concern as they find out that the mouse brain is in a coma and vitaly lacks precious salt at key areas of the brain. As a result they take a detour to a local salt deposits. They fight some bacteria and get the salt. While the older brother blood cell Вадим (Vadim) is alone from the group. He is sneaky approached by the tapeworm to join his cause. Vadim refuses and Lucifer escapes.
The trio enters the brain. While going to the Parietal lobe (the brain cerebrum area responsible for the continous), Smith the youngest blood cell, gets knocked over by an electrical pulse of the brain and pluments into the temporal lobe area, where all of the memory is stored. The rest of the two continue their journey. Smith sees the mouses memories and is puzzled by them. Lucifer emerges from the darkness explaining what they are. He says that if the mouse is to come back from the coma, it will relay the information that will cause the death of millions of Americans and if he fails to wake up, the mice’s whole family will be executed by the KGB. He tells the young blood cell, that if he wore to join him, neither outcome will occur. Smith joins them. During this time the dou blood cells are attacked by a huge horde of bacteria. The grandfather sacrifices himself so as his grandchild could live and finish the mission.  Вадим (Vadim) mons his grandfather's death.
 Вадим (Vadim) reaches the Parietal lobe. As he walks towards the center where he needs to deposit the salt. His brother falls through the ceiling. Explaining he found a weird way to get here, but he lost his part of the salt.  Вадим (Vadim) gives him his half. Lucifer emerges in front of them. Smith walks to his side. Вадим (Vadim) curses his brother for the betrayal and begins to battle the tapeworm. As Lucifer is about to kill his badly wounded brother. Smith stabs the antagonist with a broken down salt crystal (a homemade salt crystal shiv). The brothers hug it out. The brains environment all of a sudden begins to turn dark really fast, the mouse condition is worsening. Smith alone runs to the center to deposit the salt minerals. As he is about to throw the salt in the center. He stops. Having flashbacks of what he saw and heard from Lucifer and why the mouse is in a coma. He looks to his brother who is shounting him to do it. A single tear comes out of Smiths eye. The end.

### Koma characters
There are 5 characters in the Кома board game, 3 of which are playable. They serve to enrich the overall lore and story of the board game. The reason for this is to give the player a more emotional and memorable experience, by making the player care about these characters and their stories.
The action of the game takes place in the body of Артур (Arthur) - the communist mouse. Артур was born and raised in a soviet laboratory. As a fully grown mouse he has dark grey fur, deep black eyes and wearing a ushanka (a russian hat). He is emotionally very cold, seeks perfection in his work and a true patriot of the soviet union. His main goal is to complete the assignment given to him by the KGB (the soviet intelligence group)
	One of the main protagonists is a young blood cell named Вадим (Vadim). He works his job as a blood cell with great devotion to the soviet union. He looks like any other blood cell, but he wears a ushanka (a russian hat) with a red start in the middle. 
	Another young protagonist is Smith, brother to Вадим (Vadim). He believes in the wester principles of truth, justice and the American way and constantly talks about it with other blood cells. He wears a baseball cap and sunglasses and has some blue spots on his red body. His goal is to one day escape to a westerner mouse blood stream.
	Finally, the last protagonist,  Иван (Ivan). He is the grandfather of both Вадим and Smith. He is an alcoholic blood cell that is reminiscent of the old days and critiques the younger generation whenever he is sober. He contributes less to the overall work, since he spends most of his time drunk. To distinguish himself from the rest he wears and old WW2 soviet helmet.
Lastly the main antagonist named Lucifer, the tapeworm. He looks just like any other worm. However he is missing both his eyes and his lips are black with broken teeth. He follows his nature of destruction at first. But when there is a chance he would talk to his victims, as he is a very good psychologist. He would try to convince them to join his cause, that going against nature is a good thing. This is done so by taking control of the host body (Артур (Arthur) the mouse) and forging his own path.
